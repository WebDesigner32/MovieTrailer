##**Purpose of Website**

To allow for the box art of favorite movies to be displayed and clicked on for movie trailers to be viewed.

##**How to Obtain Code**

Assuming you are at my MovieTrailer repo on Github, https://github.com/WebDesigner32/MovieTrailer, click the Download ZIP button on the aside panel to obtain my code.

##**How to Open Movie Trailer Website**

1. Install Python.

2. After the project is downloaded, open the project file entertainment_center.py in IDLE and then run it.

3. Upon running the file, the browser will display the Movie Trailer site.

##**Sources**

Please note that because two of the provided Udacity trailer links were dysfunctional, I provided two
different trailer links that are widely popular on YouTube. To give credit where it is due and to obey
the Honor Code, the sources for these trailer links are:

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRdxXPV9GNQ
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOF93SzX6s

##**Exceeding Expectations**

I made the body color orange, I changed the title to "Landon's Movie Trailers!", and I made the element with class="navbar=brand" and href="#" display "Landon's Movie Trailers"
at the top of the webpage.
